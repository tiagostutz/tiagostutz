## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just love to code software that is actually used by people on a relevant matter. Of course I'm able to work with any stack to get a job done, but I do have my preferences: Docker, ReactJS, NextJS, Golang, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Python/Jupyter, MySQL, MongoDB, Mosquitto, Prometheus, Grafana, Prisma ORM (GraphQL), Bootstrap4 and Tailwind. 
I have solid experience with Fullstack development and UX/UI design, but in the past two years I've beeing working mainly with Backend and Cloud Ops.
